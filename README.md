TSTextMapper
===

Couple of classes allow you to map a text inside `UILabel` and make the text inside tappable, means it adds the ability to detect which word is tapped. Itâ€™s both very simple and powerful.

You can watch it in action [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomkowz/TSTextMapper/master/tstextmapper.mov?token=ACMkyV3t6zt3rxSuxcMKOyXMRRbaeuI5ks5UXCP0wA%3D%3D).

### How-To

1. Create `TSTextMapper` instance with font and size of the `UILabel`.
2. Select one of few methods how mapper should work `mapTextAndMakeAllTappable` or `mapTextWithTappableRanges`
3. Call `textForPoint` method.


---
- `mapTextAndMakeAllTappable` method makes all text tappable.

- `mapTextWithTappableRanges` method makes tappable text only in passed ranges.

- `textForPoint` method returns `TSTextProxy`. It contains property `value`.

### Debug

If you noticed that something may be wrong with detecting touches you can do few things:

- In `TSTextMapper` is `debug` method and it's commented inside `map` method. Put a breakpoint on line `debugView.snapshot()` in `debug` method. Method is called for the first time when `UILabel` is touched.
- In `TSTextAnalizer` is `debug` method and it's commented inside `mapLines` method. Uncomment it. It's called when `UILabel` is touched for the first time. Entire text should be printed out and the text should be presented in lines the same like it looks inside `UILabel`.
- In `TSTextRefDetector` there is `debug` method which is commented in `textRefs` method. Uncomment it. All words and whitespaces should be printed out.
